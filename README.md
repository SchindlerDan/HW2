# CIS263-The-STL

Complete the following functions.  Do not change any function signature!

> **You MUST use the STL functions to perform the operations.  Each function ```HINTS:``` section will tell you which function to learn to complete the task.  If you do not use that function, you will not earn the points.**

Remember:

- interface for this one is provided for you already in the ```*.h``` file.
- all implementation should be in the ```src/stl_functions.cpp``` file.
- don't forget to include libraries.
- pay attention to the ```HINTS: ``` sections.

1.  ```std::vector<int> copyVec(const std::vector<int> & oldVector);``` - Should produce an exact copy (as far as the ```std::equal``` function is concerned) of the provided ```oldVector```.

2.  ```void sortVec(std::vector<int> & oldVector);``` - Should sort ```oldVector``` in incrementing order using the ```std::sort()``` function.
3.  ```void doubleVec(std::vector<int> & oldVector);``` - Write a function that doubles every number in ```oldVector```.  The function must use the ```std::for_each``` function.
